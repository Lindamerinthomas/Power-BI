Becoming an intermediate-level expert in Power BI involves mastering various aspects of data visualization, data modeling, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), and report creation. Here's a list of topics to focus on:

1. Data Importing and Transformation:
 - Learn to import data from different sources (Excel, CSV, databases, web sources, etc.).

 2. Data Modeling:
 - Understand relationships between tables.
 - Master techniques like creating calculated columns, measures, and hierarchies.
 - Explore advanced modeling concepts like role-playing dimensions, bi-directional filtering, and many-to-many relationships.

3. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):
 - Study DAX functions and their syntax.
 - Practice writing complex DAX calculations for business logic, such as time intelligence functions (e.g., YTD, QTD).
 - Learn about context transition and evaluation contexts.

4. Visualization:
 - Experiment with different chart types (bar, line, pie, scatter, etc.).
 - Understand best practices for designing effective visualizations.
 - Practice creating custom visuals and using the formatting options effectively.

5. Advanced Features:
 - Explore advanced features like bookmarks, drill-through, and custom tooltips.
 - Learn about using parameters for dynamic filtering and what-if analysis.
 - Dive into advanced data analytics with AI visuals and R/Python integration.

6. Performance Optimization:
 - Understand techniques for optimizing report performance, such as summarization, indexing, and query folding.
 - Learn about optimizing DAX expressions for better performance.
